iTerm2 Setup
=
This is my iTerm2 setup for anyone who enjoys a fancy and productive Terminal.
I'm on OSX. I use the infamous Z shell framework [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and the highly customizable [Spaceship Prompt](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt). [This](https://twitter.com/while1/status/1100482316277874688) inspired me to share it in here.
